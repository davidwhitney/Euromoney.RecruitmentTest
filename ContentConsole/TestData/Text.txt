I won't eat swine again but Daniel.. eating fats are good but there are horrible different types of fats.. some do attribute to bad health issues. Your on a computer so instead of assuming just do your own research. Or better yet hit the "South Beach Diet" they divide the good fats vs the bad fats.. even carbs have good vs bad. By the way to the other gentleman.. plants or dare I say vegetables and fruits don't carry any fats but a potato does contain starch. But nasty pork, never again!
